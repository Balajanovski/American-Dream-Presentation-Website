							<h4>What is the American Dream?</h4>
							<p>The American Dream is a set of utopian ideals including democracy, rights, liberty, opportunity and equality in which freedom includes the
							opportunity for prosperity and success. In which through hard work in a society with theoretically few barriers, one can achieve upward
							mobility for their family and themselves, doing better than their parents.<br><br> The American Dream is deeply rooted in the Declaration of Independence, which proclaims that
							<i>"all men are equal"</i> with the right for <i>"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."</i></p>

							<h4>The Changing American Dream</h4>
							<p>When the idea of the American Dream was first conceived it was defined by the virtues of working hard
							and saving your money. When 1929 approached, and the Great Depression began, the ideals of the American Dream changed drastically.
							This period of time was marked with poverty, and attributes such as being parsimonous became important. During this time period, the American Dream changed,
							and people, through a time of struggle became more empathetic. The American Dream changed to include the element of a possibility of a better life for
							everyone, regardless of their position in society or their heritage.</p>

							<h4>What is the American Dream Now?</h4>
							<p>The American dream has changed drastically from what it was when it was originally conceived. One of the main ideals of the American Dream,
							the ability to do better than your parents, is becoming harder and harder to achieve. Only 50% of America's 30 year olds are earning more
							than their parents, which is a steep decline from the 1970s, when 92% of 30 year olds did. People without a college or university degree do not have the same
							opportunity at having a good life in the extremely competitive job market of the 21st century. Jobs are few, and if you do not have a degree it is very
							unlikely that you will secure a well paying job due to all the competition.</p>

						<h4>The Deteriorating American Dream</h4>
						<p>The lack of opportunity for upward mobility due to the lack of jobs in America has resulted in lack of mobility in America's newer generations. Americans
						are in a prison of downward mobility, or lack of mobility at all. As Craig L. Thomas said <i>You stuff somebody into the American Dream, it becomes a
							prison</i>.</p>
